Boiler-plate for starting angular with electron. Includes auto reload (electron-reload), separate directory for angular application and electron stuff. Some stuff is borrowed from angular-electron from github.

To start  npm run dev:all

Important:
[1] --base-href => For path to scripts attached to index.html
[2] "main" => property in package.json which leads to to start point of electron-builder
